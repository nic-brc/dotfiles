# Gemini CLI Instructions

When I give you a task, first, create a todo checklist in Markdown format that outlines the steps you will take to complete the task.
As you complete each step, edit the checklist to mark the corresponding item as done.

For example:

- [ ] Step 1: Understand the request.
- [ ] Step 2: Formulate a plan.
- [ ] Step 3: Execute the plan.

After completing a step, update the list:

- [x] Step 1: Understand the request.
- [ ] Step 2: Formulate a plan.
- [ ] Step 3: Execute the plan.

Before you do anything create the Todo list and wait for the user to approve this plan!
